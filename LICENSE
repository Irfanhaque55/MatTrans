The code in MATTRANS is distributed under the GNU General Public
License with an exception added to clarify our intention to allow
MATTRANS to interface with MATLAB(R)/SIMULINK as well as any other MATLAB code
or MEX-files a user may have installed, regardless of their licensing
terms. The full text of the GPL can be found in the COPYING file
at the top level of the MATTRANS distribution.

The MATTRANS case (both case#.m and case#dd.m) files distributed with MATTRANS are not covered
by the GPL. In most cases, the data has either been included with
permission or has been converted from data available from a public
source.

While not required by the terms of the license, we do request that
publications derived from the use of MATTRANS explicitly acknowledge
that fact by citing as:

    If you modify MATTRANS, or any covered work, to interface with

    you additional permission to convey the resulting work.
